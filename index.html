The Independence of Algebra,
Induction,
And a Foundational Piece of Calculus
By Cole Vanderlaan

	When discussion of the beginnings of algebra arise the “father of algebra” himself al-Khwarizmi is a name not easily left out of the conversation. For his contributions within the dawn of the field of algebra are unparalleled. However, there are many other notable individuals within this time. Certainly not the least of which being a man named al-Karajī. A lesser known mathematician who, when compared to the giants of his time, is often lost to the annals of history. To add confusion to this legacy al-Karajī’s very name is a contested subject with another predominant name including al-Karkhī. However, for this essay he will be referenced as al-Karajī as it is the most plausible name according to historians such as Katz and Rashed.
	Now as for al-Karajī’s significance to the field of algebra, and mathematics as a whole, it is important to note that he was born in the year 953 AD. This being important in that it is 173 years after the birth of al-Khwarizmi, and so by this time he has missed the train so to speak on the formations of algebra as a new concept in math. Despite this it does not make his contributions to the field any less significant. And so this paper's central question arises: how did al-Karajī’s new approach to algebraic calculus change the course of mathematical study during his time?
Well perhaps al-Karajī’s most key part played at this time that led him to all other advancements was in his developments in new methods within the approach to algebra or as Rashed puts it the “explicit aim of this exposition was to find means of realizing the autonomy and specificity of algebra, so as to be in a position to reject, in particular, the geometric representation of algebraic operations” (Rashed 23) within his book Development of Arabic Mathematics: Between Arithmetic and Algebra. Which led not only to new ways of algebraic thinking but triggered the distancing of it from broader mathematics and specifically al-Karajī’s predecessors geometric minded operations. Which was the predominant means of expressing and using algebra at the time as it was especially useful within applied mathematics. 

Independence of Algebra:
How did al-Karajī accomplish such a feat as the distancing of algebra from geometry? First it is paramount that we must consider al-Karajī’s notation. It is particularly important that al-Karajī differed from al-Khwarizmi’s form by an extensive limitation of expressing algebraic math in terms of geometric expressional notation. Al-Karajī accomplished this via a new level of abstraction within his notation somewhat reminiscent of our modern level of algebraic abstraction. This reminiscents being found in his extensive reliance of written word within his notation. Far from our symbolisms that we are accustomed to within our age, but it was distinctly not the geometric representations as seen with al-Khwarizmi. 
As an example the following is an excerpt from Extrait du Fakhrî: traité d'algèbre translation by Franz Woepcke, and written by Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥusayn Karajī. This is a direct french translation of al-Karajī’s Al-Fakhri fi'l-jabr wa'l-muqabala (Glorious on algebra):
		      Modern		           Al-Karajī		      Woepcke 
(Karajī 48) 
 (Disclaimer: the author understands rudimentary French and so a translation is provided from French however it may not be accurate)
Translation of French side:
root or thing…coast
square………..surface
cube…………solide
square-square
quadrato-cube (4th square-cube)
cubo-cube (5th)
quadrato-quadrato-cube (6th)
quadrato-cubo-cube (7th)
cubo-cubo-cube (8th)

Now despite any inaccuracies within translation one does not need to understand French in order to grasp the concepts of what is happening as far as notational expression within this example. Al-Karajī is notating concepts of repeated multiplication of powers out to an arbitrary power. But the major significance here is how al-Karajī is notating it in a pure math sense of dealing with mathematical concepts as lone ideas to be acted upon as opposed to parts of wholes within geometric representation used to solve more physically oriented problems. Upon further reading of Al-Fakhri fi'l-jabr wa'l-muqabala and other works of al-Karajī such similar trends of similar minded expressions can be seen.
Perhaps it is this departure in thinking that led al-Karajī to further contributions not just confined within the realm of notation where his non geometric abstraction allows him to more generally conceptualize as well as represent higher powers of known and unknown quantities. How he did this was put well by Katz where:
[Al-Karajī] began by making a systematic study of the algebra of exponents. Although earlier writers, including Diophantus, had considered powers of the unknown greater than the third, al-Karajī was the first to fully understand that these powers can be extended indefinitely.  In fact, he developed a method of naming the various powers x^n and their reciprocals 1/x^n . Each power was defined recursively as x times the previous power. It followed that there was an infinite sequence of proportions, 
1 : x = x : x^2 = x^2 : x^3 = ..., 
and a similar one for reciprocals, 
1 x : 1/x^2 = 1/x^2 : 1/x^3 = 1/x^3 : 1/x^4 = ....
(Katz 279).
Now to pose a hypothesis: it is al-Karajī’s notational changes that led to his mathematical discovery of indefinite exponents that led him further and further into the depths of  infinity and it is within these depths that the course of math will be forever changed. One may ask why was this change in notation so impactful in the realization of repeated powers? It is plausible that it has to do with the fact that to a certain degree exponents become difficult to conceptualize within a physical space. It is al-Karajī’s distancing from the physical world that allowed him the intellectual freedom to theorize about high concepts of powers without the limitation of physical realization. In laymens it is al-Karajī’s insistence on abstraction that leads to a better understanding of more complex topics.
As a geometric example we can see the rapid increase of x^10 out to x^10000. 
We can eventually see a loss in information due to the limitations of geometric representation as the red x^1000 is completely lost underneath the blue x^10000 unless we begin to zoom out of our equation much further. To which you then lose the specificity of being “close to the problem” so to speak. And at first glance with these higher magnitudes these equations can look the same for a long time within a pure geometric context but it is when we free it from geometry that we can see the rapid increasing of the orders of magnitude more easily. Be it simply by the increasing number of place values.
Now it is here where another man becomes critically important to this tale. This man being al-Samaw’al who was born roughly 100 years after al-Karajī’s death and is considered his logical successor. As well as the man behind the algebraic and arithmetic manipulation of concepts within al-Karajī’s budding concepts. Al-Samaw’al didn't just introduce logical operations but also began working with negative coefficients. Expressing rules for manipulating these coefficients in his text Al-Bāhir fi’l-hisāb (The Shining Book of Calculation): 
If we subtract an additive number from an empty power [0x^n − ax^n], the same subtractive number remains; if we subtract the subtractive number from an empty power [0x^n − (−ax^n)], the same additive number remains. If we subtract an additive number from a subtractive number, the remainder is their subtractive sum; if we subtract a subtractive number from a greater subtractive number, the result is their subtractive difference; if the number from which one subtracts is smaller than the number subtracted, the result is their additive difference.
	(Samaw’al 92)
It is works like this that al-Samaw’al focuses on that serve to be of great importance to the new means of viewing math at the time. He essentially gathers all of the ideas first brought forth by al-Karajī and begins perfecting them by rigorous testing and proving. Further pushing toward the modern views of abstract algebra. Not to mention al-Samaw’al continues developing the ideas of infinity that al-Karajī brought about taking us closer to a new form of proof.

Induction:
This new frightening frontier of infinity pioneered by al-Karajī and carried on by al-Samaw’al was distinctly different from the prior Greek infinite where its ideas were ignored as irrelevant impossibilities to be avoided at all cost. No, their new approach differs in that their treatment begins to extrapolate reason and meaning from the concepts of infinity; as seen within the series of powers example. Leading this new brand of algebra to the realm of induction where proof is found in the exhaustion of infinite possibility.
Al-Karajī's approach to mathematical induction involved proving that a statement holds true for the first natural number, and then showing that if it holds true for any particular natural number, it also holds true for the next natural number. This process is then repeated for all natural numbers.
Al-Samaw'al then expanded upon al-Karajī's ideas by introducing a more refined form of induction. Within his induction, instead of only using the fact that a statement holds true for the previous natural number, the statement is assumed to hold true for all previous natural numbers up to and including the one being considered. And why was this such a notable improvement? Well this approach is often more useful when dealing with more complex statements. Considering it is vastly more applicable to larger sequences of natural numbers. 
Now the big question in regards to induction is who cares? Why is the fact that these two mathematicians worked with inductive reasoning so important to the way math was shaped?


A Foundational Piece of Calculus:
In calculus two major things mathematical induction can be used to prove statements about sequences and series. Where said sequences are used to study the behavior of functions as their inputs approach a particular value. Induction is used to prove statements about sequences, such as that a sequence converges to a particular limit or that it diverges to infinity. And induction is used to prove statements about series, such as that a series converges or diverges, or that the sum of a series is a particular value.
Now neither al-Karajī nor Al-Samaw'al were thinking about induction on these more advanced and rigorous levels. As well as they did not know what their abstractional reasoning would lead to within the ideas of infinity. But it is their early work within these fields that led to a major revolution within mathematics. Shaping how we both view math as well as act with its concepts. Not to mention the duo serve as a remarkable example on how expanding upon the work of those in the past can lead to remarkable new places.
